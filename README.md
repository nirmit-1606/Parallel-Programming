## Understandings

The projects in this repository use C/C++ for most of its programming. You should be comfortable with the concepts of function calls, arrays, for-loops, structures, arrays of structures, structures of arrays, pointers, stacks, queues, trees, and linked lists.  

It would be good if you know how to use the Linux command line and tools such as: ls, mv, cp, mkdir, cd, pwd, rm, echo, gcc/g++, and diversion to a file. It will also help if you know at least one Linux-based editor (vim is good).
